    Implement an Iterated Substitution Permutation cipher consisting of Nr = 4 rounds, with the following
    specifications:
      1. Each round consists of round-key mixing followed by a substitution and a permutation.
      2. Assume the plain text and cipher text, each to be 8-bits long.
      3. The key schedule is generated by selecting (4r-3)-th through (4r+4)-th key bits as the round key for
         round r. (The minimum length of the key is given by 1×8+ Nr×4=24 bits. Select a random string of 24 bits as the
         key.)
      4. The round key mixing is done by a bitwise XOR operation.
      5. Perform key whitening at the beginning and end of each round.
      6. Assuming l = 4, the substitution function at each round is specified by the following S-box:
                      Input     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
                      Output    E 4 D 1 2 F B 8 3 A 6 C 5 9 0 7

      7. The permutation function for each round is:
                      Input     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
                      Output    1 4 5 7 3 6 2 8
         (Drop the permutation function at the last round. Think why.)
         Implement both the encryption and decryption functions for the above cipher, in the following modes of
         encipherment:
                    Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode,
                    Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode
                            
    

    Sample Run : 
    
        Enter the of Substitution Key.
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 
        14 4 13 1 2 15 11 8 3 10 6 12 5 9 0 7

        Enter the of Permutation Key.
        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
        1 4 5 7 3 6 2 8
